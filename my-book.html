                    Happy Birthday Rabeel, Zoofi ke Rabeel. First and foremost, I'm very grateful to Allah for this beautiful relation.
                This is very beautiful bond that we share and I'm also very
            thankful to you for everything you have done for me.
        <br> You are an amazing person who always supports me, appreciates me and cares for me.  </p>

                    You are not just a person for me with whom I'll have husband wife relationship only. But I have found a whole family in you, a loving partner, caring as mother, supportive as a father, my best friend and a crime partner with whom I can be wild with, my confidant with whom I can share everything, a little kid too (kaka)XD and a teacher who teaches me and definitely my monkooo. </p>

                        Because of you I have also found such a lovely family too , a loving father and mother. Although mama(Rubina Mama) is not with us but her upbringing and how you talk about her and her qualities with so much love makes me feel like she is always with us, as we never lose those who live in our hearts, and InshaAllah we'll meet her Jannah.

You deserve to be loved , cared, respected, happy, and all the best things in this world and hereafter.InshaAllah you'll be my king and I'll be your queen and we'll make our little empire very beautiful and worth living.
